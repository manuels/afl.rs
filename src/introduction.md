# Introduction

[Fuzz testing][] is a software testing technique used to find security and stability issues by providing pseudo-random data as input to the software. [American fuzzy lop][american-fuzzy-lop] is a popular, effective, and modern fuzz testing tool. This library, afl.rs, allows one to run AFL on code written in [the Rust programming language][rust].
